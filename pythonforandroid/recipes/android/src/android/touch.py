"""Touch interception helpers for Python for Android.

This module exposes two utilities to hook into the Android SDL surface's
intercept touch mechanism via pyjnius:

- `OnInterceptTouchListener`: a thin bridge class that implements the
  Java interface `SDLSurface.OnInterceptTouchListener` and delegates to a
  provided Python callable.
- `TouchListener`: a convenience class with helpers to register/unregister
  the intercept listener and a hit-testing routine against the Kivy
  `Window` to decide whether a touch should be consumed.
- `TouchListener.register_listener` requires a `target_widget` argument,
  which is used for hit-testing to decide whether to consume touches.
- Touch coordinates are taken from pointer index 0 and converted to Kivy's
  coordinate system by inverting Y relative to `Window.height`.

Dependencies: pyjnius for bridging to Android, and Kivy for window and
widget traversal used in hit-testing.

    a reference to a specific `target_widget` used during hit-testing to
    decide whether touches should be consumed.

    A small hit-testing helper walks the Kivy `Window` widget tree to
    determine whether a touch should be intercepted (consumed) or allowed to
    propagate.

    Notes:
    - The intercept listener affects the entire SDL surface and thus the
      whole app; use with care.
    - The internal `__listener` attribute stores the active listener
      instance when registered, or `None` when not set.
    - The internal `__target_widget` holds the widget against which the
      hit-test is compared and is cleared on `unregister_listener()`.

        What it does now (current behavior):
        - Reads touch coordinates from pointer index 0 using `event.getX(0)`
          and `event.getY(0)`.
        - Converts Android coordinates to Kivy coordinates by inverting the Y
          axis relative to `Window.height`.
        - Iterates over `Window.children` in reverse (front-to-back) and uses
          `TouchListener._pick` to select the deepest widget under the touch
          for each top-level child.
        - Compares the picked widget with the internally stored
          `__target_widget` that was provided to `register_listener(...)`.
        - Returns `True` (consume/intercept) only when the picked widget is
          exactly `__target_widget` and no other widget was found under the
          touch (`final_widget is None`). Otherwise returns `False`.

        Important notes and limitations:
        - There is no filtering by MotionEvent action; all actions reaching
          this callback are evaluated the same way.
        - Only pointer index 0 is considered; multi-touch pointers other than
          index 0 are ignored.
        - The check is identity-based (`is`) against `__target_widget`.
        - If another widget (other than `__target_widget`) is hit, the event
          is not intercepted and will propagate normally.

        Parameters:
            event: The Android `MotionEvent` that triggered the listener.

        Returns:
            bool: `True` to consume the touch when the hit-test selects the
